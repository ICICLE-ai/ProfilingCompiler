# The Cetus Project
Cetus Source to Source compiler improvements are being done at the University of Delaware. In this release, we release cetus base plus an static profiling feature and the instructions to use it.

# Setting up cetus

## Requirements

For being able to set up and run cetus, the following tools are required.

1. Java JDK 1.8+ (JDK + JRE)
2. GCC 

## From packed binaries
For packed binaries, you will see the following files:
1. configure.sh
2. ```lib``` folder with:
   1. rsyntaxtextarea.jar
   2. smart-profiler.jar

For setting up the binaries we recommend to run the ```configure.sh``` within the same folder, it is located. 
It will create the ```profile.sh``` file, a single bash command to run the jar files properly.

Then we recommend setting up the main folder (i.e. ÔΩêrofiler-release-1.0.0) to your PATH variable so you can call ```profiler.sh``` anywhere
when using the command line.

# Features

## Preprocessing C programs.
Cetus uses cpp preprocessor. If your program depends on several headers or is a multiple directories project, you can set the ```CPATH``` env variable and this will be used by the preprocessor.

## Cetus-Profiler.
Cetus profiler is a set of tools that performs static analysis of C programs.

### How to use it      
To activate static profiling within Cetus, you need to pass the flag -program_analysis

```bash
cetus -program-analysis program.c

# or if you have the ./profiler.sh
./profiler.sh -program-analysis program.c
```

### Detailing csv columns
In the output file: ***ProgramFeatures.csv***, you will find several column names:

**Important note**
Cetus' static profiler handles data sizes and loop sizes in different ways. When it comes to profiling data sizes, loops, or inputs, they can be either numerical or symbolic, depending on the program and whether data sizes are available at compilation time.


1. **application_name**  
   The name of the application being analyzed. This is detected by the tool automatically (it will commonly use the .c source file).

2. **loop_id**  
   Identifier for the loop being measured within the application. Using the standard cetus notation **function#loop_id#loopnest_id#...#loopnest_n_id**

3. **data_size**  
   Size of the data being processed by the loop.

4. **no_iterations**  
   Number of iterations performed by the loop in one execution.

5. **total_iterations**  
   Total number of iterations the loop has executed over its lifetime.

6. **no_loads**  
   Number of memory load operations performed by the loop.

7. **no_stores**  
   Number of memory store operations performed by the loop.

8. **no_instructions**  
   Total number of instructions executed within the loop.

9. **no_statements**  
   Total number of statements inside the loop.

10. **loopness_level**  
    Depth or nesting level of the loop in the application.

11. **no_bits_per_iteration**  
    Number of bits processed during each iteration of the loop.

12. **no_times_data_type_changed**  
    Number of times the operating data type is changed during loop execution.

13. **no_integer_operations**  
    Number of integer operations performed by the loop.

14. **no_float_operations**  
    Number of floating-point operations performed by the loop.

15. **no_double_operations**  
    Number of double-precision floating-point operations executed in the loop.

16. **no_long_double_operations**  
    Number of long double precision operations executed in the loop.

17. **no_long_operations**  
    Number of long-type operations performed by the loop.

18. **no_short_operations**  
    Number of short-type operations performed by the loop.

19. **bigo_notation**  
    Time complexity of the loop expressed in Big O notation.

20. **no_multiplications**  
    Number of multiplication operations executed by the loop.

21. **no_substractions**  
    Number of subtraction operations executed by the loop.

22. **no_sums**  
    Number of addition operations executed by the loop.

23. **no_side_effect_free_function_calls**  
    Number of function calls in the loop that do not produce side effects.

24. **data_dependence_free**  
    Indicates whether the loop is free from data dependence.

25. **ratio_reduction_statements**  
    Ratio of statements in the loop related to reduction operations.

26. **ratio_remaining_flow_dependences**  
    Ratio of remaining flow dependences in the loop.




Cetus will export the result of the static analysis into a CSV file. For this purpose, it is **required** to create a folder called **out** inside the workplace you will run Cetus program analysis.

### Extra parameters

For choosing the output file for the resulting static analysis you need to use the following flag:

```bash
-program-features-output=/path/to/directory/myoutput.csv
## Set output file for program features e.g., -program-features-output=myoutput.csv
```

if ```program-features-output``` is not set, Cetus will expect a folder called ```out``` and it will store the profiling results there in a CSV file.

If you desire to append the results of newly analyzed programs to a current CSV file containing information, you need to pass the following flag to Cetus
```bash
-append-program-features=true
## Change filemode to append to the output file for program featurese.g., -append-program-features=true
```

# Test cases
To test the validity of profiler binaries, we have provided several examples within the folder ```resources/profiler/tests```.

To validate the output of the tool, you need to verify the folder ```profiler/tests/test-results```, it has pre-generated profiling results from the examples in the ```tests``` folder. 

If the folder out does not exist, it is required to create it, by default the compiler will use the folder ```out``` in the current ($pwd) folder.
